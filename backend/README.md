This directory contains the core backend server responsible for:

- Express API server and routes
- IMAP connection and email ingestion
- Event bus for server-sent events (SSE)

Other backend-related modules such as AI pipelines, notifications, and AI replies live in their own top-level directories to keep concerns separated.
